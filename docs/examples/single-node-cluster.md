If you want to initialize a cluster with only one node,
specify single master node in cluster configuration file:

```yaml title="single-node.yaml" 
cluster:
  ...
  nodes:
    master:
      instances:
      - id: 1
        ip: 10.10.64.5 # (1)!
        mac: "52:54:00:00:00:40" # (2)!
```

1. Static IP address. If omitted, the DHCP lease is requested.
2. Static MAC address. If omitted, the MAC address is generated.

Do not forget to remove (or comment out) the worker and load balancer nodes.

Apply the cluster:
```sh
kubitect apply --config single-node.yaml
```

Your master node now also becomes a worker node.

!!! note "Note"

    If you do not specify worker nodes, all master nodes also become worker nodes.
