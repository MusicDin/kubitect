    ### Example - Install KVM

    For example, to install the [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org) (Kernel Virtual Machine) hypervisor and libvirt, use *yum* or *apt* to install the following packages:

    + `qemu`
    + `qemu-kvm`
    + `libvirt-clients`
    + `libvirt-daemon`
    + `libvirt-daemon-system`

    After installation, also add user to the `kvm` and `libvirt` groups.
