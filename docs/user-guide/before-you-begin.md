The user guide is divided into three subsections: *Cluster Management*, *Configuration* and *Reference*.
The Cluster Management subsection introduces the operations that can be performed over the cluster.
The Configuration subsection contains explanations of the configurable Kubitect properties.
Finally, the Reference subsection contains a configuration and CLI reference.

The following **symbol conventions** are used throughout the user guide:

+ :material-tag-arrow-up-outline: - Indicates the Kubitect version in which the property was either added or last modified.
+ :material-alert-circle-outline:{ .icon-required } - Indicates that the property is required in every valid configuration.
+ :octicons-file-symlink-file-24: - Indicates the default value of the property.
+ :material-flask-outline: - Indicates that the feature or property is experimental (not yet stable). This means that its implementation may change drastically over time and that its activation may lead to unexpected behavior.
